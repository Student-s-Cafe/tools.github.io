# MultiTool | All-in-One Web Utility Platform

https://student-s-cafe.github.io/tools.github.io/

MultiTool is a simple, client-side web application providing a collection of handy online utility tools all in one place. Designed for quick and easy access directly within your browser, it offers various tools for working with text, images, data, and security.

## Features

MultiTool currently includes the following functional tools:

### Text Tools

*   **Text Case Converter:** Convert text between different cases (UPPERCASE, lowercase, Title Case, Sentence case, camelCase, PascalCase).
*   **Character & Word Counter:** Get real-time counts of characters, words, and lines in your text.
*   **Lorem Ipsum Generator:** Generate dummy text paragraphs and sentences for design and testing purposes.
*   **Text Diff Checker:** Compare two blocks of text line by line to identify differences.

### Image Tools

*   **Image Compressor:** Compress JPG, PNG, and WEBP images (client-side processing).
*   **Image Format Converter:** Convert images between JPG, PNG, WEBP, and GIF formats (client-side processing).
    *   *Note:* Client-side image processing has limitations, especially with large files and complex formats like animated GIFs during conversion.

### Data Converters

*   **JSON to CSV Converter:** Convert a flat JSON array of objects into CSV format. Includes sample data loading.
*   **Base64 Encoder/Decoder:** Encode text to Base64 or decode Base64 strings back to text.

### Security Tools

*   **Password Generator:** Generate strong, customizable passwords based on length and character types. Includes a basic strength indicator.
*   **Password Strength Checker:** Analyze the strength of a password based on length, complexity, and character mix, providing basic feedback.

## Getting Started

This is a single-page application (`index.html`) and does not require any server-side setup to run the client-side functionalities.

1.  **Save the file:** Ensure the provided `index.html` file is saved on your computer.
2.  **Open in browser:** Simply open the `index.html` file using any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

All the tools accessible from the tabs at the top of the page should be immediately available for use within your browser.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** Structure of the web page.
*   **CSS3:** Styling, including custom styles and utility classes.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling. (Included via CDN)
*   **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** Implemented the frontend logic and tool functionalities.
*   **Font Awesome:** Provides icons used throughout the interface. (Included via CDN)

## Future Enhancements

*   **PDF Tools:** The "PDF Tools" section currently contains placeholders as these functionalities (PDF to Word, PDF Merger) typically require server-side processing or complex libraries not suitable for a pure client-side implementation with the available tools. Future versions could integrate with a backend service or a dedicated client-side library to enable these features.
*   **More Tools:** Adding more useful utility tools based on user needs.
*   **Improved UI/UX:** Further enhancements to the user interface and user experience.
*   **Advanced Features:** Implementing more advanced options for existing tools (e.g., more image manipulation options, different data formats, advanced password strength analysis).
